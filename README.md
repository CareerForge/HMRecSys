# HM Recommender System

This repository contains my solution to the H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations competition on Kaggle. The challenge involves developing a recommendation system to predict personalized product recommendations for H&M customers, leveraging a rich dataset of customer demographics, purchase history, and product details.

**Key Highlights:**
- Problem: Build a model that ranks articles based on their likelihood of being purchased by each customer.
- Data: Includes customer information, product metadata, and transactional data for millions of purchases.
- Approach: <TODO>
- Tools & Libraries: <TODO>
- Results: <TODO>

This project demonstrates advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning techniques for solving large-scale recommendation problems.
